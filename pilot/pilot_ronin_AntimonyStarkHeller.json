		"Details": "Orphaned at an early age, Antimony grew up under the tutelage of a private security contractor who worked for his parents before their passing. Inheriting a generous estate, Antimony would grow into a pampered yet fierce young man with a penchant for violence. Following in his foster father's footsteps, he entered the world of corporate security and asset protection. The small skirmishes between private security and pirates in backwater corporate holdings generally involved little oversight, regulation, or investigations of any sort that suited him well.\nAntimony would become a proficient soldier in petty warfare against irregular forces throughout his career. Yet in a defeat he suffered early in life, he would be left the victim a chemical nerve agent which would leave his motor skills severely impaired for the rest of his life. As a result Antimony would grow disillusioned and resentful of both the corporations and raider-pirates that seemed to be an ever-present cause of strife around him. Antimony's anger would drive him away from a civilized principles of law and order and back into the fray in a place where he could sate his desire for violence in service only to himself: the arena.\n\n\n\nDespite his disadvantage, Antimony remains a strong contender in all forms of sports combat. As his failing prowess as a warrior leaves him less than desirable combatant, it has nevertheless made way for the rise of a cunning tactician that has defeated countless opponents who underestimate his ability. Still, despite his successes, the call of unstructured combat on a battlefield is a difficult lure to resist, and Antimony finds himself fighting in all sorts of places.",
